    "## Create BM25 Index\n",
    "Here we create the BM25 index. This is required for our custom Hybrid search engine, wherein it will be used as the sparse retrieval layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "Some background -\n",
    "- Relying on a single embedding of description is brittle.\n",
    "- Dense embedding search on a large corpus of documents is time consuming\n",
    "- Due to the nature of certain documents (containing thousands of rows), creating a dense-embedding of each document will mask context around certain keywords. Due to this, dense-embeddings may fail at throwing relevant documents even when there are instances of keyword match, due to the sheer size of the document, due to which the keyword matches get masked behind the dense-embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter this, BM25 based retrieval will be used as the first layer, because it is efficient, and less RAM intensive than dense retrieval models. These will rely on exact-term matching. These are lightweight, and will allow us to reduce the search space from thousands of candidate documents to a few hundred \"possibly\" relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, here's a good read on sparse vs dense retrievals - [SPLADE for Sparse Vector Search Explained](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/splade/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started."
